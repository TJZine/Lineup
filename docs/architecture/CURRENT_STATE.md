# Current Architecture State

> Established 2026-03-05. This is the canonical current-state architecture document for Lineup.

## Scope

Use this document for the repo’s present-day architecture truth.

If another architecture doc disagrees with this one, update the other doc or archive it.

## Product Invariants

- Lineup is a client-side TypeScript application for LG webOS.
- It connects directly to Plex services; there is no Lineup cloud backend.
- Scheduling, state, and most orchestration happen locally on the device.
- The app prioritizes deterministic channel behavior and a zero-transcode bias where possible.

## Composition Roots

### `src/bootstrap.ts`

- environment bootstrap
- startup wiring entry

### `src/App.ts`

- application shell composition
- startup flow and screen/runtime bootstrap
- should stay thin and avoid regaining feature-specific logic

### `src/core/InitializationCoordinator.ts`

- focused startup sequencing collaborator between app shell and orchestrator

### `src/Orchestrator.ts`

- central runtime coordinator
- should remain focused on wiring, lifecycle orchestration, and top-level runtime delegation rather than absorbing more feature logic

## Module Boundaries

### Lifecycle

- `src/modules/lifecycle/`
- owns lifecycle state, visibility, persistence coordination, and recovery concerns

### Navigation

- `src/modules/navigation/`
- owns remote handling, focus/navigation flow, and navigation coordination

### Plex

- `src/modules/plex/auth/`
- `src/modules/plex/discovery/`
- `src/modules/plex/library/`
- `src/modules/plex/stream/`
- owns Plex-facing auth, discovery, library metadata, and stream/subtitle policy
- `src/modules/plex/auth/clientIdentifier.ts` is the explicit owner for `lineup_client_id` resolution and persistence (`resolveClientIdentifier(preferred?: string): string`)

### Scheduler And Channel Management

- `src/modules/scheduler/`
- owns scheduling behavior, shuffle logic, and channel domain flows

### Player

- `src/modules/player/`
- owns playback runtime, subtitle attachment/conversion, keep-alive, and player recovery behavior

### Settings And Persistence Owners

- `src/modules/ui/settings/SettingsStore.ts`
- `src/modules/settings/AudioSettingsStore.ts`
- `src/modules/debug/DebugOverridesStore.ts`
- `src/modules/plex/discovery/ServerSelectionStore.ts`
- `src/modules/scheduler/channel-manager/ChannelPersistenceStore.ts`
- `src/modules/plex/auth/clientIdentifier.ts`
- these are the current designated owners for storage-backed state

### UI

- `src/modules/ui/`
- owns TV screens, overlays, shared primitives, and user-visible composition
- visual rules are governed by [`docs/design/ui-design-language.md`](../design/ui-design-language.md)

## Current Hotspots

The main structural hotspots still called out by the cleanup backlog are:

- `src/Orchestrator.ts`
- `src/App.ts`
- `src/modules/ui/epg/EPGComponent.ts`
- `src/modules/ui/settings/SettingsScreen.ts`
- `src/modules/ui/channel-setup/ChannelSetupScreen.ts`
- `src/modules/plex/stream/PlexStreamResolver.ts`
- `src/modules/scheduler/channel-manager/ChannelManager.ts`

The active remediation queue for these is [`ARCHITECTURE_CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE_CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md).

## Working Rules

- Keep composition roots thin.
- Prefer explicit collaborators, stores, binders, and coordinators over large multipurpose classes.
- Keep persistence behind typed owners.
- Keep Plex transport/policy logic inside Plex modules.
- Keep UI classes focused on rendering, focus, and bounded UI coordination.
